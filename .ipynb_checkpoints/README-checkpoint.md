# What the Software does:
What this program does is asks the user for 2 inputs, the first being the user's name and the second being the user's age. Then if the userâ€™s age is above 21 it prints out the user's name and that they can drink. If the user enters an age below 21 then it will print out the user's name and in how many years they can drink.

# How to use it:
To run our program you need python 3. Install the repository, then open the canDrink.ipynb using python 3. 

# Usage:
You can use our software to determine if you or others you know can drink, and if you can not in how many years you can.
